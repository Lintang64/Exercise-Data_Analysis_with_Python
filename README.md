# Exercise-Data_Wrangling_Process
This data analysis project starts by running the data wrangling process first. This process has goals, among others  collect all the data needed; 
1. assess the quality of the data that has been collected; 
2. And cleaning the data so that it is ready for analysis.

The following are the stages in this analysis.
1. Preparation phase. 
2. Data gathering stage.
3. Data assessing stage.
4. Data cleaning stage.

# Exercise-Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Objective : Continue the Dicoding Collection (data wrangling) data analysis project by running the EDA process. This process has goals, among others
- create an analytical or business question you want to find an answer to; And
- explore each data to find interesting insights to answer these business questions.

Process flow : The following are the stages in this analysis.
1. Preparation phase.
2. The stage of determining business questions for data exploration.
3. Data exploration stage.

Preparation :
Defining Business Questions
    
As we discussed before, to determine a question, we need to understand the business problem at hand first. So, in this project, we are faced with an example from an online fashion company called Dicoding Collection or DiCo for short.
As a company engaged in online fashion, DiCo needs to evaluate sales performance and understand the most purchased fashion items. Apart from that, he also needs to understand his customers better so he can create a more efficient campaign strategy.

Based on these problems, several business questions can be defined as follows:
1. How has the company's sales and revenue been performing in the last few months?
2. What products sell the most and the least?
3. What are the customer demographics that we have?
4. When was the last time a customer made a transaction?
5. How often did a customer make a purchase in the last few months?
6. How much money have customers spent in recent months?

# Exercise-Data_Visualization
After understanding the theory of data visualization and explanatory analysis, now is the time for us to apply them in a simple data analysis project. In this material, we will continue the Dicoding Collection data analysis project.

Objective : First, we will continue our Dicoding Collection data analysis project by carrying out the process of creating data visualization and explanatory analysis. This process has the following objectives:
1. answer all analytical or business questions that have previously been made; And
2. create data visualization to facilitate the delivery of data analysis results.

Training Flow : The following are the stages in this exercise.
1. Preparation.
2. Create data visualizations that answer business questions.

Before starting to do this exercise, there are several things that must be prepared first. 
1. Prepare Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook which was previously used in the Exploratory Data Analysis training material.
2. Make sure you run all the code in the notebook again.

After the preparation stage is complete, we will enter the stage of making data visualization and conducting explanatory analysis. As previously discussed, at this stage we will focus on answering various business questions that we have previously created.

In the material for Exploratory Data Analysis, we have defined several business questions as follows.
1. How has the company's sales and revenue been performing in the last few months?
2. What products sell the most and the least?
3. What are the customer demographics that we have?
4. When was the last time a customer made a transaction?
5. How often did a customer make a purchase in the last few months?
6. How much money have customers spent in recent months?
