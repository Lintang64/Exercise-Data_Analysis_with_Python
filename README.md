Defining Business Questions
    
As we discussed before, to determine a question, we need to understand the business problem at hand first. So, in this project, we are faced with an example from an online fashion company called Dicoding Collection or DiCo for short.
As a company engaged in online fashion, DiCo needs to evaluate sales performance and understand the most purchased fashion items. Apart from that, he also needs to understand his customers better so he can create a more efficient campaign strategy.

Based on these problems, several business questions can be defined as follows:
1. How has the company's sales and revenue been performing in the last few months?
2. What products sell the most and the least?
3. What are the customer demographics that we have?
4. When was the last time a customer made a transaction?
5. How often did a customer make a purchase in the last few months?
6. How much money have customers spent in recent months?
